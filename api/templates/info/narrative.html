    <h1 class="display-4">The Mission</h1>
    <p>Events ATX is an application designed to help people do things together. It allows
    people to organize events and sort out times and locations so that they can spend more time
    doing things and less times organizing.</p>
    
    <h1 class="display-4">The Journey</h1>
    <p>Events ATX was made by two graduate students, Malik Ouda and Matt Viteri
    at the University of Texas at Austin. It was made as part of an academic project
    for their Advanced Developement and Programming course. This website was built
    over a series of 3 phases:</p>
    <h3>Phase 1</h3>
    <p>We built the basic foundation of the project by designing a MySQL database
    and using pymysql to create basic controller functions for creating users, events,
    and so on.</p>
    <h3>Phase 2</h3>
    <p>During this phase, we built a website frontend for the application. We did this
    using Django for the web framework and the Google App Engine to host the website. 
    The frontend was designed completely using Bootstrap.</p>
    <h3>Phase 3</h3>
    <p>This was the last phase of the project, where we created an Android app in Android Studio
    using Kotlin. We interacted with the backend using API calls we set up during Phase 2.</p>
